createDataset.py: this was ran once to generate the dataset (stored in processed_data)

GaussianNaiveBayes.py: Our Naive bayes class

SklearnNaiveBayes.py: Naive bayes class using Sklearn

evaluateNaiveBayes.py: Used to test performance of both naive bayes models

runNaiveBayes.py: Used to load images and run both of our naive bayes tests. It also prints out a confusion matrix

MLP.py: Contains all MLP model architectures (base, deep, shallow, small hidden, large hidden) and training functions

runMLP.py: Used to train all MLP variants and save them to the models directory. Prints evaluation metrics for each model

evaluateMLP.py: Used to load saved MLP models and evaluate their performance on the test set
